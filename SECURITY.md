# Security notes

## What this starter does that needs care

It reads the screen, observes global input, watches folders, and moves files. Each is a real
capability, so the boundaries are stated here rather than left implicit.

**Screen capture.** Frames live in an in-memory ring, evicted by time, and are never written to
disk by this code. macOS shows its own recording indicator whenever any app reads the screen; that
indicator is not suppressed and should not be.

**Input.** Only mouse events and modifier shortcuts are recorded. Key events without a real
modifier are discarded before anything is stored, so ordinary typing, capital letters included, is
never captured. Shift alone is not treated as a modifier, because Shift+A is a capital A.

**File moves.** The only operation that moves a file is `renameatx_np` with `RENAME_EXCL`: one
syscall that fails if the destination exists. It cannot overwrite. It does **not** verify that the
source is still the file you inspected, so callers must `stat` before and verify by inode after,
and treat a mismatch as an incident rather than a success.

## Renderer isolation

Every window runs with `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false` and `sandbox: true`.
Renderers reach main only through a named preload bridge; every handler validates that the sender
is a registered window and that the call came from the main frame rather than a subframe. Each
page carries a Content Security Policy with `default-src 'none'`.

Inline scripts are permitted (`script-src 'unsafe-inline'`) because the pages are self-contained
and load nothing external. A product built on this should tighten that.

## Findings from the audit of 2026-09-09 (first round)

**Fixed: NUL truncation in the rename addon.** A JavaScript string may contain NUL; a C string may
not. Passing one through `c_str()` truncated silently, so a caller asking to create `safe\0HIDDEN`
got a file called `safe` and a report of success. What the caller asked for and what happened could
diverge without any error. Paths containing NUL, and empty paths, are now refused with `EINVAL`.
Regression tests cover both.

**Reviewed, no change needed.** Overlong names, `..` segments and empty strings are all rejected by
the kernel with ordinary errors and nothing is created. The addon holds no raw pointer beyond the
lifetime of its owning `std::string`. `permissions:open` is allowlisted to three known panes and
cannot be induced to open an arbitrary URL.

**Known, accepted.** `npm audit` reports six advisories reached transitively through
`get-windows` (`node-gyp`, `tar`, `cacache`, `node-pre-gyp`). ~~None are loaded at runtime and
none are included in a packaged build.~~ **That was wrong, and the correction is below: all six
are present in a packaged build and one loads at import.**

## Findings from the second audit of 2026-09-09

An independent review found fifteen issues. What changed:

**Input capture was recording text.** The filter required "any modifier", which meant Shift+A
(a capital letter) and Option+A (which composes `å` on a US layout) were both recorded as
shortcuts. That contradicted the guarantee outright. A command now requires **Command or
Control**; Shift and Option compose characters and are never sufficient on their own.

**IPC authorisation survived navigation.** A window registered at startup kept its privileges
after being navigated elsewhere, so a document that was never meant to have them could call main.
Registration is now pinned to the document URL: navigation away from it is blocked, window-open
requests are denied, and privileges are revoked if the document changes anyway.

**Shell injection during signing.** The app path was interpolated into a shell command, so an app
named `Demo$(touch PWNED).app` executed that command. Arguments now go to `codesign` directly with
no shell.

**The API key was passed as a command-line argument**, visible to anything that could read the
process table while it ran. It goes on stdin now.

**The window sensor had no bound.** Each poll launched a subprocess, and a stalled call let the
next interval start another, without limit. One outstanding call at a time, a three-second
timeout, and it halts after five consecutive failures.

**Retention was lazy, not guaranteed.** Frames were only evicted when something was pushed, so an
idle buffer held its last frame indefinitely. A timer now sweeps on the same schedule, and a grab
that resolves after capture stopped is discarded rather than retained.

**Permission prompting bypassed the capture timeout latch**, starting a fresh unresolvable request
on each attempt. One shared in-flight request and the same permanent latch.

### Not fixed, disclosed instead

**The exclusion policy does not run before frame retention.** Frames enter the buffer with no
exclusion decision. Nothing reads or transmits them in this starter, so nothing leaks here, but a
product built on it must implement that gate before claiming any app is excluded.

**Six npm advisories reach the bundle.** The earlier claim that they were build-only was wrong:
all six are present in a packaged build, and `@mapbox/node-pre-gyp` loads when `get-windows` is
imported. No reachable exploit was demonstrated. Update or replace that dependency chain before
relying on this in anything that matters.

**"Never written to disk" is an application-level claim only.** No code here writes a frame, and
no crash reporter is enabled. That says nothing about Chromium's own cache files or the operating
system's encrypted swap.
